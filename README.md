<h1>UCSB-Meal-Planner</h1>
<br/>

This is a FARM stack (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) application on which users can access the nutrition information of UCSB dining hall food and build custom meal plans based on their nutrition goals.
<br/>

Users can choose the UCSB dining hall and menu (e.g. De La Guerra, lunch) using two dropdown menu components and build their meal plan by using the table with checklist component to add or remove items from their meal.
Backend features that have not been fully implemented in the application due to my lack of knowledge in React include authentication and authorization using JWT as well as endpoints for user profiles and corresponding meal plans.
